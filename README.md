Use cases:

1. Gallery/Blog Search

Actor: User

The user is browsing the website looking for a particular photo. They would
start by selecting the gallery page as starting point where all the photos might
be viewed. If the image(s) they are looking for do not appear on the top of
the list they would use the search button to attempt to find the one(s) they want.
This search button would provide a pop up overlay for the user to enter key words
to identify the photo types they wish to find. Upon hitting enter the overlay
will disappear and all the photos with tags to the search keywords will be displayed
in order of relevance. Thus the user's end goal of finding specific related photos
would be achieved.

The user is browsing the website looking at blog posts. Not all of them interest
the user. They want to filter out the ones that do not interest them while 
keeping the ones that do. Blog posts on the site will have associated tags. 
On the blog page there will be a filter of some sort that allows a user to select 
or deselect tags. This will filter the bogs to only include the selected tags, 
allowing for quick sorting and maintaining user interest and site flow.
